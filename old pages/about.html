						<p id="desc">Howdy! </br>
									My name is Arsh Siddiqui and I am a junior at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
									University pursuing a major in computer science with a minor in economics. I am also an undergraduate research 
									assistant helping to develop a taxonomy for audio augmented reality (with its 
									applications) and also currently working on a method to convert a painting into music based
									upon its properties. I enjoy helping others and attempt to do so whenever possible. I plan
									on further pursuing computer science or economics after my undergraduate program.</br>
									Thanks for stopping by!	</p>
